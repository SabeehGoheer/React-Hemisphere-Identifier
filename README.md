1. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
2. This small App was given to me as a 30 minute coding challege by a potential employer. 
3. Coding Challege was to show user on browser if he resides in northen or southern hemisphere by getting his geo-location from browser.
4. I used 'window.navigator.geolocation' service to access user's location. If this service doesn't return proper location, you might have to manually set your location from browser console's gelocation sensor.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
